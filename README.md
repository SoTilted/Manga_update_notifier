# Manga_update_notifier
This code gets the latest manga updates from many different sources(basic web scrapping)
and then it searches my Database(basic use of json files) and checks if there is a new update.
Then, with the use of a text to speech library, it tells me if there was an update or not.
This code is scheduled to run every hour.
# TO DO: 
 Fix/update the Database(Add mangas to the jason file).
 Maybe add more sources and fix the current ones.
 Add as dictionary value which website updated the latest chapter of that manga title.
