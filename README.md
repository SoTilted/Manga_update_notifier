# Manga_update_notifier
This code gets the latest manga updates from 4 different sources, and then it searches my Database(manga that i read) and checks if there is a new update.
Then, with the use of text to speech, it tells me if there was an update or not.
This code is scheduled to run once upon execution and then every 6 hours, this script can be run by hand or on start-up.
