# Manga_update_notifier
This code gets the latest manga updates from 4 different sources(basic web scrapping)
and then it searches my Database(basic use of json files) and checks if there is a new update.
Then, with the use of a text to speech library, it tells me if there was an update or not.
This code is scheduled to run once upon execution and then every 6 hours, this script can be run by hand or on start-up.
# TO DO: 
 Fix/update the Database(basically the manga i read).By fix i mean type the last chapter i've read on some manga that i just initialized them to zero.
 Maybe add more sources if needed.
 Add as dictionary value which website updated the latest chapter of that manga title.
